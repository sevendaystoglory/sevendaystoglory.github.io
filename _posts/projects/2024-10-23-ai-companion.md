# AI Cognition. And Emotions.❤️
<p class="post-date">Jul 20, 2023</p>

This is what I tweeted on January 4.

I wanted to develop an independent emotional entity that has its own desires. That can understand and reciprocate to human emotions.

What started in sometime in July 2023 as a routine mental masturbation exercise(1) went onto becoming a project(2) that finally gave rise to something meaningful in the form of a full fledged publically available application.(3)

## Chapter 1: Naive Exploration.

I had (then)recently watched the movie 'Her'. An Ai powered OS, huh? Sounds interesting! But it was not its ability to organize emails, or to write poetry that made it so fascinating. We had GPT-3.5 then. It was very useful for a lot of things (mostly writing code, and drafting content) but was is not something that <b>you could just talk to</b>. It still not is! It is the idea of companionship that drew me in.

## Chapter 2: The rise of a bully. Modelling a person's thought process.

I wanted some way in to this to tackle this problem statement. I've past experience from my research in the field of neuroscience. It came naturally to model the companion's thought process as an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06775">ACE framework</a>, drawing inspiration from the OSI model.

### A sneak peak into my architecture

### How do you control the mood? A chatbot that just meekly reciprocates the mood is boring. Its like you talking to you.

Words to self - The following should be checkmarked for the AI companion to come out as <strong>Reliable, Consistent, Intelligent, Empathetic, Intuitive, Proactive.</strong>

### The Result of all this?

All of my readings and implementations have produced very apparent differences in a legacy chatbot response and how an emotionally autonomus entity would respond.

*An ERC response is the standard 'Emotion Recognition in Conversation' reply. The ERC 3.2 is the one with ACE framework implemented along with NTVs for mood.*

## Chapter 3: Building an AI buddy for mass market!

... How I built Nora.
